# My-first-Python-Game-Codes(Rock-Paper-Scissors)
A beginner-friendly Python project implementing the Rock Paper Scissors game using conditional logic and randomization.


# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors Game (Python)

## 📌 About the Project

This project is a simple Rock–Paper–Scissors game developed using Python. The game allows a user to play against the computer, where the computer randomly selects an option and the winner is decided based on standard game rules. This project demonstrates the use of conditional logic, dictionaries, user input handling, and randomization in Python.


## ⚙️ How the Game Works

The user enters their choice:

r → Rock

p → Paper

s → Scissors

The computer randomly selects one option.

Both choices are compared using predefined rules.

The result (Win / Lose / Draw) is displayed.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

Python dictionaries for mapping user input

Random choice generation using the random module

Conditional statements (if-elif-else)

User input handling

Game logic implementation


## ✨ Features

Simple and beginner-friendly code

Uses clean logic to determine the winner

Fast execution and easy to play

Ideal project for Python beginners



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

***Python 3***

***Built-in random module***



## Then enter:

r for Rock

p for Paper

s for Scissors


## ✅ Conclusion
This project is a great starting point for learning Python fundamentals such as control flow, data structures, and user interaction. It can be further enhanced by adding score tracking, replay options, or a graphical user interface.
